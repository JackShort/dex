				<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
			    <p>
			        We are three Computer Science students attending the University of Virginia.
					More importantly, we hate ads. When's the last time you were ever glad you saw
					an ad on YouTube? For us, it's never. We want to make the Internet experience
					safer and more enjoyable for all types of media consumers. And we hope to deliver
					that experience at a fair and affordable price.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        So we came up with Dex.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        Dex is the middleman between you and the companies that offer you their product
					at the price of your privacy and bloated ads. We came up a solution that helps
					both parties. You get a faster, cleaner, better experience and the companies
					make marginally more per user.
			    </p>
				<h2>The Catch?</h2>
				<p>
					There is no catch. For just 7 dollars per month, you can choose the websites you
					visit the most. You create your own package of your top sites and those become
					mining and ad free on all your devices.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you're a social media savant, a sports fanatic, or a news junkie, we have the
					right solution for you. It's time for you to have an Internet experience you
					enjoy. Dex is here.
				</p>
				<p>
					-Jack, Joe, and Jack
