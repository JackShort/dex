###### Product
We will offer a subscription based service to remove ads and prevent data mining on the user's most visited sites. The majority of the subscription payments will be allocated to those sites proportionally by use. 

###### Need 

A point of contention that has been long running in the Internet Age is one of privacy, especially with regard to advertisements. Free sites ranging from Facebook to Google generate most of their revenue from ad purchases. However, since they get paid by the click, and more often than not, a user does not end up clicking the ad, the pay-per-click model fails to generate a significant amount of revenue per user. This forces the companies to live of sheer volume since even Facebook fails to generate more than 2$ per month per [user](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/02/facebooks-revenue-topped-5-per-user-for-the-first-time.html).  
  
We posit that a normal Internet user, whose main diet of web consumption amounts to Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram would prefer to pay a small nominal amount per month (~$7) for a complete ad-free environment and protection of their personal information. As shown in the EU, not only do users improve their experience through a sense of safety, but removal of the mining software significantly speeds up the sites' functionality.  
  
Dex will offer a way for users completely be free of ads and data selling on all their top sites on both desktop and mobile.
